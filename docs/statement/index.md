# Statement of need

Scientific computing is a complex field with many different tools and libraries.
An even more complex topic is orchestrating the acquisition of custom-built hardware setups for cutting-edge scientific projects.
The desire to have a flexible framework for building custom applications for microscopy is strong in the community, but there is yet no way to find a reacheable consensus
among interested parties to develop such framework.

The following sections illustrate the decision-making process that led to the conception of Redsun:

- [History](history.md) - The background and development history of the project
- [Mission](mission.md) - Project mission and core objectives
- [Bluesky integration](bluesky.md) - How Redsun integrates with the Bluesky ecosystem

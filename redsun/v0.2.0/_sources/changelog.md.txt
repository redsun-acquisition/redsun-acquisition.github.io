## [0.2.0]

### Changed

- Reworked the plugin system
  - The approach now loosely follows the [`napari` manifest](https://napari.org/dev/plugins/technical_references/manifest.html), where plugins are to be published via a `yaml` configuration file in the root folder of the plugin package, specifiying where the classes have to be imported.
  - The manifest is taken as the actual entry point of a plugin, which will be used to redirect to the actual imports which is executed via the standard library `importlib`.
- Added additional coverage for the ``factory`` module.
- Bumped sunflare version to ``sunflare>=0.5.0``, which implements the above changes at toolkit level
